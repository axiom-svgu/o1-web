To get started, visit our GitHub repository, which is the central hub for all project information, including weekly progress logs and future plans.

Communication happens on the 'axiom' Discord server, where you can connect with the team. You can contribute casually, picking up issues as you have time, or you can pursue a deeper commitment. For those seeking a specific role in design, architecture, development, management, or marketing, you can contact the respective team lead for more information on becoming a committed member with greater project involvement and mentorship.",
